# Bluesky Feed Generator

A Laravel project for generating Bluesky feeds you can start out with.

## Features
- Generate one or more Bluesky feeds
- Each feed can have a different publisher

## Limitations
The application only supports one service endpoint (e.g. `https://my-bluesky-feeds.example.com`). You can still run
multiple different feeds from different publishers, but they will all be served from the same endpoint.

## How to use
